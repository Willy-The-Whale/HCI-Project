This project uses C++ and the following libraries
<iostream>
<fStream>
<stdlib.h>
<string>
<vector>
<math.h>
<time.h>

The program will print out the size of the data that it stored.
It also prints out the size of 70% and the 30% array.
Finally it will print out the probabilities and the accuracy of our predictions.
It will also write it to the text file "Result.txt"

In the output it skips the data related to the 3rd column since it floods the console and text file but we do the calculations for it
so it can be outputted if needed.
