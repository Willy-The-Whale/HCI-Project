/* Objective:
Identify the Gross Pay of an individual on Unigram Language Model by Corpus Cross
Entropy

Implementation (10 points)
Create C++ (or other programing language) program(s) to complete the following tasks.
– (1 points) Get raid of rows which contains ’?’ in the data set.
– (3 points) Assign an arbitrary code to each of the attributes for all xm ∈ x .
– (6 points) Divided the data set into two parts ( 70% vs. 30% ) randomly. Do the following tasks.
• (3 points) On the 70% data set
∗ Determine the # of occurrences for each of the attributes.
∗ Determine the probability of an attribute for the class ’> 50k’ by using MLE algorithm.
∗ Determine the probability of an attribute for the class ’<= 50k’ by using MLE algorithm.
• (3 points) Test your design on 30 % data.
∗ Pretend you don’t have the class information for each of the data instances
∗ Use the Corpus Cross Entropy method to compute the entropy for each of the instance
∗ Assign an instance to a class label ∈ {> 50k, ≤ 50k} of which has the lower entropy value.
∗ Evaluate your system by the following accuracy measurement.
